# 👋 Hi, I’m @ADHD-Penguin

🧠 **Neurodivergent creator & builder** passionate about leveraging **AI to empower ADHD, AuDHD, and ASD communities**—especially in Singapore.  
From adaptive coding workflows to supportive chatbots, I craft tools that make life a bit less chaotic and a lot more connected.

---

## 👀 I’m interested in
- 🤖 **AI-driven tools for neurodiversity** — chatbots for daily challenges, emotional support, and creative brainstorming tailored to nonlinear thinking.  
- ⚙️ **Automating workflows with LLMs** (Gemini CLI, Claude Code) using `.md` files as a *“scripting language”* for no-code project setups.  
- 🧩 **Community building** — hosting library sessions for neurodiverse folks, bridging understanding between NTs, ADHDers, and ASDers.  
- 🪶 **Open-source UI tweaks and agents** — YouTube research bots, prompt categorization systems, and other “everyday helpers.”  

---

## 🌱 I’m currently learning
- 🧠 Advanced **prompt engineering** for categorizing unstructured narratives (translation, deduping, semantic splitting).  
- 🎥 Integrating **yt-dlp with AI agents** for subtitle-rich video analysis and batch channel insights.  
- 📱 Building **Telegram-orchestrated CLI macros** for remote task triggering across devices (Mac, iPad, phone).  
- 🎨 **Responsive design patterns** for adaptive tool suites—transforming rigid childhood habits into flexible, resilient code.  

---

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on
- 🌍 **Open-source neurodiversity apps** — mobile/web chatbots with free tiers for global reach, starting in Singapore.  
- 🧰 **Workflow automation prototypes** — `.md`-based SOPs for AI agents handling research, backups, or doc updates.  
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Community projects** — co-designing inclusive events, banners, or privacy-safe insight mining from forums.  
- 🧠 **UI/UX mods** for accessibility-focused tools (e.g., Gemini or Claude suites) with modern, minimal vibes.

## ⚡ Fun fact
Coding since 15 turned my *“inflexible penguin waddle”* into adaptive problem-solving.  
Now I treat AI as a **hyperfocus sidekick**, channeling ADHD chaos into creative code sprints.
